His research interests include galaxy formation, turbulence, plasma physics, and computational science education.  In his free time, he enjoys cooking, gardening, biking, and hiking.  His website can be found [here](https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/osheabr/).

#### Devin Silvia (he/him)
{% include figure.html image="/assets/img/devin.jpg" position="left" width="120px" %}
Devin is the Director of Undergraduate Studies and a teaching specialist in the [Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering](https://cmse.msu.edu). He received his PhD in [Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences](https://www.colorado.edu/aps/) from the [University of Colorado](https://www.colorado.edu) where he worked as a computational astrophysicist running simulations aimed at understanding various facets of chemical evolution in the universe. He then worked as a National Science Foundation Astronomy and Astrophysics postdoctoral fellow at MSU before joining the ranks of the CMSE faculty in 2017. In addition to his computational astrophysics research, Devin is passionate about STEM education and creating more equitable and inclusive STEM classrooms. When he's not working, he enjoys brewing beer, roasting coffee, and running all over the greater Lansing area.

### Group Members

#### Tom Finzell
{% include figure.html image="/assets/img/Finzell_Headshot.png" position="left" width="120px" %}
Tom is a Fixed-Term Assistant Professor in CMSE working in CERL. His research focuses on how students learn the computational data manipulation tools ubiquitous across all STEM disciplines, emphasizing equitably and inclusively. Tom has also worked on integrating computation into the core curriculum of physics, and more broadly, in STEM and beyond. He believes that a lack of preparation in computation can propagate historical and structural barriers that stand in the way of success for disenfranchised groups. Tom's Ph.D. work was in astronomy, focused on modeling multi-wavelength observations of gamma-ray-emitting Classical Novae, specifically focusing on the V1324 Sco. Tom used radio observations to probe the extensive properties of nova ejecta, optical data as a diagnostic of the plasma, and gamma-ray data to constrain the dynamics of the event.

#### Rachel Frisbie (she/her)
{% include figure.html image="/assets/img/pdp2020_headshot_frisbie.jpg" position="left" width="120px" %}
Rachel is a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Education Research Lab (CERL) and will be starting as an assistant professor in the Fall of 2021. She earned her PhD in 2020 in [Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://astro.natsci.msu.edu/) from [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) where she was an observational astronomer focusing on the properties of the hot, X-ray emitting gas in galaxies and galaxy clusters and how we can learn about their evolution from the gas. In CERL, she will focus on exploring student learning outcomes and attitudes in introductory computational science courses at MSU. Outside of work, Rachel enjoys powerlifting, running, playing oboe, and getting snuggles from her dog Freya.

#### Paul Hamerski (he/him)
{% include figure.html image="/assets/img/hamerski_pic.jpg" position="left" width="120px" %}
Paul is a fixed-term assistant professor in CMSE. His research is based out of CERL and he is teaching CMSE 201 in Fall 2021 and CMSE/STT 180 in Spring 2022. He recently finished his PhD doing physics education research at MSU, working with Paul Irving and Daryl McPadden. He is interested broadly in how computation can be used as a tool for learning science at the high school and undergraduate levels. His research involves applying qualitative case study to students' perspectives on the challenges that computational tools bring to science classrooms. He earned his bachelor's degree in physics and math from Carnegie Mellon University. In his free time, he likes to play board games, go camping, and enjoy Michigan's parks and breweries.

#### Emily Bolger (she/her)
{% include figure.html image="/assets/img/EmilyBolger_Headshot2.jpg" position="left" width="120px" %}
Emily is a PhD student in the Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering (CMSE) Department. She earned her bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Moravian College. Previously, she has participated in research projects at the intersection of Data Science, Statistics, and Computation. Currently, she is most interested in using computational tools to analyze educational data, specifically understanding the ways in which a student’s connections and other criteria can impact their success. Her most recent project involves analyzing social networks constructed from Slack messages of Physics instructors who are looking to better integrate computation in their classrooms. In her free time, she enjoys reading, crocheting, and dancing.

#### Sarah Castle (she/her)
{% include figure.html image="/assets/img/SarahCastle_headshot.jpeg" position="left" width="120px" %}
Sarah is a current PhD candidate in PRIME (Program for Mathematics Education) at MSU and a mathematics master’s student. She earned her bachelor’s degrees in Mathematics and Engineering Physics from Whitworth University. During this time her research projects were at the intersection of mathematics, engineering, and computation, including modeling biological fluid shifts in microgravity and evaluating electric propulsion systems for asteroid and comet sample-return missions. Sarah continued this research at Princeton in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering program before turning to mathematics education research. Her passion is exploring how computation enacted through coding in undergraduate mathematics classrooms can bring about deeper understandings of mathematical structures and develop mathematical creativity. Her most recent project focuses on introducing CMSE 201 students to linear algebra through a series of modules in Jupyter Notebooks and the relation with mathematical creativity. In her free time, she enjoys hiking, swimming, playing with her cats, and crafting.
