In particular, we explore how students learn to integrate computation into their education outside of traditional computer science courses.\n\nOur research group includes faculty, postdocs, and students from the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering and the Department of Physics and Astronomy.\n",

    "content": "\n\nGroup Leaders\n\nDanny Caballero (he/him)\n\n  \n  \n\n\nDanny is an Associate Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering. He holds the Lappan-Phillips Chair of Physics Education, co-directs the Physics Education Research Lab, and is the principal investigator of the Learning Machines Lab. He earned his Bachelor’s degree in physics from the University of Texas at Austin, and his Master’s and PhD in physics from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Danny worked as a Science Teaching Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Colorado Boulder before joining the faculty at Michigan State. His research focuses on computational education and the use of data science to address questions in STEM education. In his free time, he bikes, skateboards, and barbecues. His website can be found here.\n\nBrian O’Shea (he/him)\n\n  \n  \n\n\nBrian is a Professor in the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering and the Department of Physics and Astronomy.  He is also a member of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory and the current Director of MSU’s Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research.  Prior to joining MSU, he received his PhD in physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and was a postdoc at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the Theoretical Astrophysics Group and Applied Physics Division.  His research interests include galaxy formation, turbulence, plasma physics, and computational science education.  In his free time, he enjoys cooking, gardening, biking, and hiking.  His website can be found here.\n\nDevin Silvia (he/him)\n\n  \n  \n\n\nDevin is the Director of Undergraduate Studies and a teaching specialist in the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering. He received his PhD in Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences from the University of Colorado where he worked as a computational astrophysicist running simulations aimed at understanding various facets of chemical evolution in the universe. He then worked as a National Science Foundation Astronomy and Astrophysics postdoctoral fellow at MSU before joining the ranks of the CMSE faculty in 2017. In addition to his computational astrophysics research, Devin is passionate about STEM education and creating more equitable and inclusive STEM classrooms. When he’s not working, he enjoys brewing beer, roasting coffee, and running all over the greater Lansing area.\n\nGroup Members\n\nTom Finzell\n\n  \n  \n\n\nTom is a Fixed-Term Assistant Professor in CMSE working in CERL. His research focuses on how students learn the computational data manipulation tools ubiquitous across all STEM disciplines, emphasizing equitably and inclusively. Tom has also worked on integrating computation into the core curriculum of physics, and more broadly, in STEM and beyond. He believes that a lack of preparation in computation can propagate historical and structural barriers that stand in the way of success for disenfranchised groups. Tom’s Ph.D. work was in astronomy, focused on modeling multi-wavelength observations of gamma-ray-emitting Classical Novae, specifically focusing on the V1324 Sco. Tom used radio observations to probe the extensive properties of nova ejecta, optical data as a diagnostic of the plasma, and gamma-ray data to constrain the dynamics of the event.\n\nRachel Frisbie (she/her)\n\n  \n  \n\n\nRachel is a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Education Research Lab (CERL) and will be starting as an assistant professor in the Fall of 2021. She earned her PhD in 2020 in Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics from Michigan State University where she was an observational astronomer focusing on the properties of the hot, X-ray emitting gas in galaxies and galaxy clusters and how we can learn about their evolution from the gas. In CERL, she will focus on exploring student learning outcomes and attitudes in introductory computational science courses at MSU. Outside of work, Rachel enjoys powerlifting, running, playing oboe, and getting snuggles from her dog Freya.\n\nPaul Hamerski (he/him)\n\n  \n  \n\n\nPaul is a fixed-term assistant professor in CMSE. His research is based out of CERL and he is teaching CMSE 201 in Fall 2021 and CMSE/STT 180 in Spring 2022. He recently finished his PhD doing physics education research at MSU, working with Paul Irving and Daryl McPadden. He is interested broadly in how computation can be used as a tool for learning science at the high school and undergraduate levels. His research involves applying qualitative case study to students’ perspectives on the challenges that computational tools bring to science classrooms. He earned his bachelor’s degree in physics and math from Carnegie Mellon University. In his free time, he likes to play board games, go camping, and enjoy Michigan’s parks and breweries.\n\nEmily Bolger (she/her)\n\n  \n  \n\n\nEmily is a PhD student in the Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering (CMSE) Department. She earned her bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Moravian College. Previously, she has participated in research projects at the intersection of Data Science, Statistics, and Computation. Currently, she is most interested in using computational tools to analyze educational data, specifically understanding the ways in which a student’s connections and other criteria can impact their success. Her most recent project involves analyzing social networks constructed from Slack messages of Physics instructors who are looking to better integrate computation in their classrooms. In her free time, she enjoys reading, crocheting, and dancing.\n\nExternal Collaborators\n\nTor Ole Odden\n\n  \n  \n\n\nTor is a postdoc at the University of Oslo, Norway, where he studies how computation can be used to improve physics teaching and how machine learning methods can be applied to science education research. He holds a bachelor’s degree in physics from St. Olaf College, a master’s in physics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a PhD in physics education also from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In his spare time Tor is an active fiddle player, cross-country skier, wood-carver, and graphic novel enthusiast.\n\nFormer group members\n\nNat Hawkins\n\n  \n  \n\n\nNat is a former post-bac researcher with CERL. He is currently a PhD student in CMSE working with Dr. Arjun Krishnan. Check him out here.\n",
