### Current Projects

#### Using Resource Theory to Understand How Students Think About Indexing
##### Folks involved: T. Finzell (lead), D. Silvia, D. Caballero
Students struggle with how to loop through lists in Python, often mixing and matching their strategies between looping by value and looping by index. At the heart of this issue is the concept of indexing, which can be a challenging abstraction for students. My work uses Resource Theory, a cognitive framework based on DiSessa’s Knowledge in Pieces, to identify concepts and procedures that students activate when solving problems involving indexing.

#### Students’ Approach to Problem-Solving Computational Tasks with Functions
##### Folks involved: R. Frisbie (lead), K. Sachithanand, E. Tobias, D. Caballero, D. Silvia
Students with a variety of prior knowledge and experience with respect to computation engage in our interdisciplinary introductory computation courses. We strive to create a curriculum that brings together students’ disciplines and experiences with computer science concepts, data analysis, and computational modeling. This project encompasses two different research avenues. (1) Qualitative interviews with students centered on computational tasks involving functions and (2) Exploration of the impact of research findings integrated into introductory curricula. The data generated consist of student interviews where they describe their thought processes aloud while engaging in tasks presented in a Jupyter notebook. In particular, I compare the characteristics of the pathways that students take to arrive at a solution to a particular task.
