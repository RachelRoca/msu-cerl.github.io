#### Using Resource Theory to Understand How Students Think About Indexing
##### Folks involved: T. Finzell (lead), D. Silvia, D. Caballero
Students struggle with how to loop through lists in Python, often mixing and matching their strategies between looping by value and looping by index. At the heart of this issue is the concept of indexing, which can be a challenging abstraction for students. My work uses Resource Theory, a cognitive framework based on DiSessaâ€™s Knowledge in Pieces, to identify concepts and procedures that students activate when solving problems involving indexing.
